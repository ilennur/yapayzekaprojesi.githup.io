Restify - Digital Fatigue Prediction and Recommendation System

About the Project

Restify is a Flask-based web application designed to predict digital fatigue levels and provide users with personalized recommendations accordingly. User inputs are analyzed using a machine learning model to calculate fatigue levels and deliver tailored suggestions.

Features

â€¢User Input: Collects information such as screen time, break duration, sleep time, device type, and purpose of use.

â€¢Fatigue Calculation: Predicts digital fatigue levels using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm.

â€¢Recommendation System: Provides relaxing suggestions based on the user's fatigue level and current environment.

â€¢Visualization: Generates insights into the user's digital usage habits through visualizations.

Technologies Used

â€¢Backend: Python, Flask

â€¢Frontend: HTML

â€¢Data Processing and Modeling: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)

â€¢Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Installation

Install the Required Dependencies:

pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Run the Project:

python app.py

Launch the Application:
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser to view the application.

Usage

â€¢Users fill out the form with details (e.g., screen time, break duration, sleep time, device type).

â€¢The Flask application processes user inputs and predicts fatigue levels using the model.

â€¢Recommendations are displayed based on the fatigue level.

â€¢Visualizations of digital usage habits are available for users to view.

Example Form Fields

â€¢Daily screen time (in minutes)

â€¢Daily break duration (in minutes)

â€¢Sleep duration (in hours)

â€¢User age

â€¢Device type (phone, tablet, computer)

â€¢Purpose of use (education, work, entertainment)

â€¢Current environment (home, library, office)

â€¢User gender

Recommendations

The recommendation system provides suggestions based on the userâ€™s fatigue level and environment, such as:

â€¢Home: "Apply the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. ðŸ‘€ðŸ’ª"

â€¢Office: "Take a 10-minute break by closing your eyes and relaxing in a dark environment. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ›‹"

â€¢Library: "Practice deep breathing or step outside for fresh air. Maintain proper screen distance to reduce eyeÂ strain.Â ðŸŒ¬ðŸ“–"
